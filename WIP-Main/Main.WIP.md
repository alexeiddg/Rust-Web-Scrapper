Efficient Use of Asynchronous Programming:

Rust's async and await can be more efficient for I/O-bound tasks like web scraping because they allow other tasks to run while waiting for I/O operations to complete.
Minimize Lock Contention:

Using locks (Mutex) can lead to contention and can be a bottleneck. Minimize the use of shared state protected by locks. Use lock-free data structures or atomics if possible.
Batch Processing and Pipeline Parallelism:

Process batches of URLs at a time rather than one by one. Use a pipeline approach where different stages (fetching, parsing, processing) run in parallel.
Memory Management:

Efficient memory management is crucial. Avoid unnecessary allocations and deallocations. Use Arc and Rc wisely to share data between threads without excessive cloning.
Optimize the HTML Parsing:

Make sure the HTML parsing library is efficient. If html5ever is too slow, consider alternatives or optimize the usage.
Profile and Benchmark:

Regularly profile your application to identify bottlenecks. Use tools like perf, flamegraph, and Rust's built-in cargo bench.
Network Optimizations:

Optimize network requests by reusing connections (keep-alive), using a faster HTTP client, or even implementing custom DNS resolution if necessary.
Parallelizing Computations:

If your model involves significant computation, consider parallelizing those computations using libraries like rayon
